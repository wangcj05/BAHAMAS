# BAHAMAS
Bayesian and Human Reliability Analysis-Aided Method for the Reliability Analysis of Software (BAHAMAS)

![BAHAMAS architecture](docs/pics/bahamas_structure.png)

BAHAMAS evaluates software failures by tracking **defect introduction** and **defect removal** activities, their impact on the types of defects that may remain within software, and ultimately the **probability of software failure**.

The BAHAMAS Bayesian Belief Network (BBN) consists of the following nodes:

- **Red nodes**: Account for the introduction of defects by considering human errors at each stage of the Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC).
- **Blue nodes**: Account for the defect removal activities employed during the SDLC.
- **Purple nodes**: Account for the types of defects that remain in the software at any given stage of the SDLC.
- **Yellow node**: Accounts for the types of defects that remain in the software after all stages of the SDLC.
- **Green node**: Accounts for the software failure probability, based on the defects that remain in the software after the SDLC.

In total, BAHAMAS employs the following concepts. When accounting for defect introduction and removal, specific types of defects will remain in the software. Depending on the types of defects that remain, the software will exhibit certain failure modes.

## Installation

Install required libraries:

```bash
  conda create -n bahamas_libs python=3.13
  conda activate bahamas_libs
  pip install toml streamlit==1.35 streamlit-aggrid==1.1.5 numpy>=1.24 pandas==2.3 scipy openpyxl pytest plotly kaleido matplotlib streamlit-option-menu jsonpointer streamlit_extras
```

This can be installed with pip (perferably in a venv):

```bash
pip install --verbose .
```

or


```bash
pip install --verbose --editable .
```
and then run with a command like:

```bash
bahamas -i examples/bnn.toml
```

The tests can be run with:

```bash
pytest
```

## Example: Software Failure Probability Evaluation

### Run

```bash
conda activate bahamas_libs
cd /path/to/BAHAMAS/examples
python ../bahamas/main.py -i bbn.toml
```

### BAHAMAS Input

  [BBN.params]
  samples = 40000
  seed = 2

  [BBN.files]
  task = "../data/Task_List.xlsx"
  defect = "../data/Defect_Data.xlsx"
  approx = "../data/sdlc_macro.xlsx"

  [BBN.analysis]

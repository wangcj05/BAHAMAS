# BAHAMAS

Bayesian and Human Reliability Analysis-Aided Method for the Reliability Analysis of Software (BAHAMAS) evaluates software failures by tracking **defect introduction** and **defect removal** activities, their impact on the types of defects that may remain within software, and ultimately the **probability of software failure**.

This app allows you to perform the following analyses.

**Features:**
- **Preliminary Assessment**: which enables efficient estimation of software failure probability using stage-level evaluations of SDLC activities to support early design decisions.
- **Comprehensive  Assessment**: which provides more detailed and refined failure probability estimates based on in-depth evaluations of development activities.
- **Common Cause Analysis**: which identifies potential software-related CCFs through the determination of common cause component groups (CCCGs) based on software-specific coupling factors
- **Software quality assessment survey**: offering a structured, survey-based approach to assess software reliability attributes;
- **CCCG evaluation**: which assesses the vulnerability of each CCCG to CCF using both qualitative and quantitative measures.
